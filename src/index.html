<div class="intro">
  <p>
    An archive of projects that I've worked on. Both unfinished and finished, alone or with other people. However, all unpaid and made for the sake of making (or a school deadline).
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not contain everything I've ever worked on. I'm still finding and collating&nbsp;stuff.
  </p>

  <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a portfolio. For starters, a bunch of this is stuff I made as a kid.</p>

  <p>
    But as time goes on environments change, formats become obsolete and data gets lost. I want a place of preservation to say "hey, these things&nbsp;existed".
